# WebResume
This is a repository for my historical resume app online.<br>
They are usually built with different techniques, and being suspended for different reasons.<br>
Take it for fun if you are interested in this.
## Tech:
### 1.0:
* Flask
* MongoDB
### 2.0:
* Swift (Vapor)
* MongoDB

## Back Story:
This is literally my first web app, although most of the work was in the backend<br>
I hated to build web pages, cuz I believed they are too design-oriented instead of programming-oriented<br>
In order to introduce myself better to employers, I built my first web resume<br>
Which is simple as only one html file with bunch of css and js files<br>
It was modified directly from the template of [mdl](https://getmdl.io/templates/text-only/index.html)<br>
After a while, I decided that I should add some more functionalities to the project. Therefore, I came up an idea of building a web with a backend<br>
This led me to the web resume 1.0:<br>
* I used flask as the framework, because I had already played around with it when I was doing my iOS programming
* MongoDB was opted, because it was the symbol of cool technique in my mind, and I was never a fan of MySQL
* I barely learnt how to build html, css, and javascript. That's why the web page is beautiful but not perfect for me.
* I have some more ideas need to express, which is not completable by simply changing background and colours
Hereby, I started from the scratch to build my own css files and html<br>
This is the web resume 2.0:<br>
* This was literally the first time I write html and css. I had lots of stupid questions, but gladly solved them with my friend Alex
* I was still ignorant to javascript, so I had to google every function I wanted
* I altered the language to Swift, cuz, why not. 
* I think I need more explainations to this Swift thing. Firstly, I am an iOS developer; secondly, I don't use Objective-C. Aren't these enough?
* With removing extra functionalities that were in the 1.0, the 2.0 was completed
* It was much simpler than the 1.0, but much more beautiful from my aspect. I loved it
This is basically it. I have built the two versions. And the third version is not started yet. However, I will make them soon before the September

## Feedbacks:
Swift is not a proper language for web. It is never elegant as Python<br>
Vapor leaf is not good as jinja2, and not stable enough either<br>
MongoDB is the best :wink: <br>
